> Library Management System using Django in Python

This project is testing Library Management System for my own. This is a
web-based application developed in Python and Django Framework. This
simple python project manages the School Library's Borrowing
Transaction. It provides an online and automated platform for the
management to store and retrieve the books and borrowing records
efficiently and effectively. The project was developed also using the
Bootstrap Framework for the user interface and jQuery to give end-user
a better experience while using the application. It also consists of
user-friendly features and functionalities.
